# Data_Science_for_Genomics_Training
This is a three month program to train students who deal with the -omics on data science and machine learning concepts to use in genomics.

# Program Details
The program will have three components: Foundational skills, Soft skills, Project and writing your life compass.
The program will take place for 2.5-3 months. 3 weeks of foundational skills learning, and 9 weeks of projects. The soft skills will be distributed within the 9 weeks of the projects to be done practically as the participants learn.

# Deployment  
* [] Docker
* [] Kubernetes
* [] mybinder.org

# Foundational skills  
* [] Fundamentals of Data Privacy and Anonymization
* [] Data manipulation in Python, SQL, R & Bash
* [] Data visualization in Python, R & Bash   
* [] Machine learning: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning  

# Soft skils  
* [] Communication on social media 
* [] Presentation
* [] Writing a blogpost & Teaching
* [] Project management

# Projects  
Participants will be required to select 2 projects max to work on over a period of 9 weeks, based on their interests and under the guidance of a mentor. Documentation of progress and communication will be key in this phase. The projects they can choose from include:
* [] Phylogenetics of 16S rRNA of drug resistant microbes.
* [] Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks or Long Short-TermMemory (Deep learning) with scoring methods to compare sequences of interest.
* [] Cell Segmentation project and adaptation of work to bioinformatics.
* [] Exploring human 16S rRNA replicating study with investigator methods.
* [] Kenya kombucha versus United States(Oakland, California) Kombucha.
* [] Epidemic scanner: Use a couple of sources to determine when the next outbreak of a certain disease will occur.
* [] Resume scanner: Use webscraping and Natural Language Processing to determine what skills a candidate is lacking to be on the bleeding edge of the workforce.

# Life compass   
This is basically what do you want to do, how can you sustain what you want to do and how can you foster a growth mindset. Don't write it here. Please do that somewhere else safe.

# Goal 
Become an effective genomic data scientist who can translate a problem explained by someone into a data science project & deploy your work online.
