# Data_Science_for_Genomics_Training
This is a three month program to train students who deal with the -omics on data science and machine learning concepts to use in genomics.

## Program.
The program will have three components: Foundational skills, Soft skills, Project and writing your life compass.
The program will take place for 2.5-3 months. 3 weeks of foundational skills learning, and 9 weeks of projects. The soft skills will be distributed within the 9 weeks of the projects to be done practically as the participants learn.

### Foundational Skills
These will be taught for 3 weeks, a week for each component. The approach will be a mix of handson and handsoff, with the participants provided with material they need to follow and will have 2 virtual weekly sessions with a mentor to learn and ask questions. The areas to be taught include:
- Intro/refresher to data science, python, R, SQL, bash 
- Fundamentals of Data Privacy and Anonymization
- Data manipulation in Python, SQL, R & Bash
- Data visualization in Python, R & Bash

### Soft Skills
These will be taught in the form of talks, where we will have speakers who are good in these fields talk to our participants about having these skills and how to build them. Practically, the participants will make presentations about their work constantly as well as communicate them on social media and in the form of blogs.  
- Communication on social media
= Presentation of projects
- Writing a blogpost & Teaching 
- Time management
- Project management

### Projects
Participants will be required to select 2 projects max to work on over a period of 9 weeks, under the guidance of a mentor. Ensuring that they document their work properly, and manage their time sufficiently. They'll be required to choose among the following projects:
- Phylogenetics of 16S rRNA of drug resistant microbes.
- Siamese Convulotinal Neural Networks or Long Short-TermMemory (Deep learning) with scoring methods to compare sequences of interest.
- Cell Segmentation project and adaptation of work to bioinformatics.
- Exploring human 16S rRNA replicating study with investigator methods.
- Kenya kombucha versus United States(Oakland, California) Kombucha.
- Epidemic scanner: Use a couple of sources to determine when the next outbreak of a certain disease will occur.
- Resume scanner: Use webscraping and Natural Language Processing to determine what skills a candidate is lacking to be on the bleeding edge of the workforce.
